# crop-prediction-ml
This is a crop prediction project that compares several supervised machine learning models such as decision trees, random forest and k-nearest neighbors using manual hyperparameter tuning, grid search and randomized search, together with cross-validation and train/validation/test splits for the dataset.

Please check the Jupyter notebook which contains code together with explanations :)
